## Abstract

Member functions should be passeable as alias template arguments.

## Rationale

"Regular" aliases can be assigned to a member function like this:

```d
struct S {
  void f() { }
}
S s;
alias f = s.f;
```

But it does not work for template arguments:

```d
template t(alias f) { }
t(s.f); // does not compile
```

## Description

I propose to allow member functions as template alias arguments.

The benefits of this change are obvious.
