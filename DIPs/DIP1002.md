## Abstract

In Python, the try/catch/finally syntax is augmented with an additional clause,
termed else. It is a fantastically useful addition to the conventional syntax.
It works like this:

``` python
    try:
        do_something()
    except Exception as e:
        pass # Runs when an error inheriting from Exception was raised
    else:
        pass # Runs when no error was raised
    finally:
        pass # Runs unconditionally, evaluates last
```

## Description

The _TryStatement_ would gain an additional piece, _TryElseStatement_, which
should be present after all _Catches_ and before a _FinallyStatement_, if any.

The code in a _TryElseStatement_ would occur after the try's _ScopeStatement_,
would occur only if no exception was thrown, and would occur before the
_FinallyStatement_, if any is present. If any error occurs inside a
_TryElseStatement_, its corresponding _FinallyStatement_ is still evaluated.

### Rationale

Having such a facility built in to D's exception handling will allow the writing
of cleaner, less user-error-prone code.

This is a proven and commonly-used pattern present in Python, a prominent
language, and it can be added to D without breaking any existing code.

As described by [@JackStouffer](https://github.com/JackStouffer):
Here is an example in puesdo-code reduced from a real-world code base.
It's a project that reads values from sensors and then saves them to a server.
As noted, this can currently be achieved without the else clause, but it
makes things clearer.

``` python
try:
    for sensor in sensor_objects:
        get_value()  # this can throw
        if value is not None and value != 'NULL':
            save_value()  # this can throw
except IOError:
    change_notifier_state(bad)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    change_notifier_state(bad)
    exit()
except (SeverException, ConnectionException) as e:
    # if there's server trouble, wait longer to
    # avoid DDOSing the server
    time.sleep(45)
    change_notifier_state(bad)
else:
    change_notifier_state(good)
    time.sleep(5)
```

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

This addition should not break any existing code.

### Examples

With the additional exception handling syntax, it would become possible to
write code like this:

``` D
try
{
    do_a_thing();
}
catch(Exception exception)
{
    handle_error();
}
else
{
    depends_on_success_of_thing();
}
finally
{
    do_this_always();
}
```

This _can_ be expressed in D today, but its equivalent is much more verbose:

``` D
bool success = false;
try
{
    do_a_thing();
    success = true;
}
catch(Exception exception)
{
    handle_error();
}
finally
{
    try
    {
        if(success)
        {
            depends_on_success_of_thing();
        }
    }
    finally
    {
        do_this_always();
    }
}
```

### Reviews

#### NG discussion thread 1

In [NG discussion thread](http://forum.dlang.org/thread/gruemzcqaupwptfcbefs@forum.dlang.org) both Andrei
and Walter have commented on the topic:

- http://forum.dlang.org/post/nsfgkm$1ikm$1@digitalmars.com
- http://forum.dlang.org/post/nsfsip$25bd$1@digitalmars.com

Some of mentioned issues:

- DIP language is too informal
- No mention of why the similar feature has not gained traction in languages other than Python
- Missed braking change with nested `try` -> `if/else` -> `try/catch`
- Lack of references to real project code snippets that show the improvement
- No consideration of scope guards (which are not present in Python)
