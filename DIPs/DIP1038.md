## Abstract

This DIP proposes a new attribute, `@nodiscard`, that allows the programmer to
make ignoring a function's return value into a compile-time error. It can be
used to implement alternative error-handling mechanisms for code that cannot
use exceptions, and to prevent bugs when interfacing with external functions
that report errors via their return values.

## Rationale

### Error handling without exceptions

Currently in D, the only generally-applicable way for a function to send a
signal to its caller that the caller cannot ignore is to throw an exception.
For a variety of reasons, however, the use of exceptions is not always possible
or desirable. Examples of code that may want or need to avoid exceptions
include:

* code that is written in a language other than D (for example, C or C++)
* code written in D that may be called from another language
* code that does not want to depend on the D runtime
* code that cannot afford the runtime performance overhead of exceptions

Since D is intended to be a systems language suitable for writing low-level,
high-performance code with seamless C and C++ interoperability, its feature set
should support reliable error handling in all of these use-cases.

#### Alternatives

One possible alternative to exceptions, [proposed by Vladimir
Panteleev][SuccessType], is for a function to return an error code wrapped in a
`struct` that `assert`s (or `throw`s) in its destructor at runtime if it has
not been used (where "using" means calling a particular method). While this
addresses some of the use-cases above, it has several shortcomings compared to
`@nodiscard`:

* It reports ignored errors at runtime rather than compile time.
* It cannot be used directly with functions written in other languages.
* It requires additional syntax in both the callee and its callers to wrap
  and unwrap the error code.

By contrast, `@nodiscard` can be used without caveats to provide compile-time
protection against ignored errors in all of the use-cases listed above.

Another alternative is for a function to return error information via an `out`
parameter. Since a call to the function will not compile with a missing
argument, the calling code is forced at compile time to visibly acknowledge the
possibility of an error.

Unfortunately, using `out` parameters for error handling is not a
general-purpose solution because the programmer is not always free to change a
function's signature to include an `out` parameter. Reasons for this include:

* The function's signature is part of an established public API, and changing
  it would break other code.
* The function is used as a callback by another function that requires it to
  have a specific signature.
* The function is an operator overload.

By contrast, `@nodiscard` can be used with any function because all functions
have a return type.

### Functions without specified side effects

Some functions have side effects but are nevertheless unlikely to be called for
those side effects alone. Examples of such functions include:

* functions that acquire resources, such as `malloc` and `mmap`
* functions that generate random numbers, such as `rand` and `uniform`
* generic functions that may or may not cause side effects depending on their
  arguments, such as `filter` and `map`

What these functions have in common is that their side effects, if any, are
considered implementation details, rather than being part of their documented
behavior. As a result, calling code cannot rely on them to cause any *specific*
side effects without risking breakage if and when those implementation details
change.

Though ignoring the return values of these functions is unlikely to result in
disaster, it is still a probable programming mistake which `@nodiscard` could
help guard against.

This DIP does not recommend adding `@nodiscard` to any existing functions in
Phobos or the D runtime since doing so would constitute a breaking API change.
However, authors of new code would still benefit from having `@nodiscard` in
the language, and existing projects (including Phobos and the D runtime) could
adopt `@nodiscard` on a case-by-case basis if the benefit were judged to be
worth the potential for breakage.

## Prior Work

### In D

The D compiler already warns about discarding the value of an expression with
no side effects, including a call to a strongly-`pure` and `nothrow` function.
An attribute that would allow the programmer to mark specific functions or
types as non-discardable has been proposed several times on the D issue tracker
and forums; see the [Reference](#reference) section below for details.

## Description

`@nodiscard` is a compiler-recognized user-defined attribute declared in the D
runtime module `core.attribute`. It takes no arguments.

An expression is considered to be discarded if and only if either of the
following is true:

* it is the top-level *Expression* in an *ExpressionStatement*, or
* it is the *AssignExpression* on the left-hand side of the comma in a
  *CommaExpression*.

It is a compile-time error to discard an expression if either of the following
is true:

* it is a call to a function whose declaration is annotated with
  `@nodiscard`, or
* it is not an assignment expression, and its type is an aggregate (a `struct`,
  `union`, `class`, or `interface`) whose declaration is annotated with
  `@nodiscard`.

Note that the former is a syntax-level check, while the latter is a type-level
check. This means that the *value* returned from a `@nodiscard` function may in
fact be discarded as long as the function call itself is enclosed in some other
expression. For example:

```d
// un-annotated type
struct Result { int n; }

// @nodiscard function
@nodiscard Result func() { return Result(0); }

void main()
{
    import std.stdio: writeln;

    // no error: the return value of func is "used" by the comma expression
    (writeln("side effect"), func());
}
```

By contrast, a value of a `@nodiscard` type will always cause an error if it is
discarded, regardless of the expression that discards it:

```d
// @nodiscard type
@nodiscard struct Result { int n; }

// un-annotated function
Result func() { return Result(0); }

void main()
{
    import std.stdio: writeln;

    // error: the return type of func is also the type of the comma expression
    (writeln("side effect"), func());
}
```

In all cases, an error resulting from `@nodiscard` can be suppressed by
prepending `cast(void)` to the offending expression, since a *CastExpression*
is not a function call and `void` is not an aggregate type annotated with
`@nodiscard`.

Using `@nodiscard` has no effects on the semantics of a program other than
those described above. In particular:

* `@nodiscard` is not part of the type of any symbol it is applied to, and does
  not participate in name mangling.
* A `@nodiscard` annotation on a function or aggregate declaration does not
  apply to declarations inside that function or aggregate's body (that is,
  `@nodiscard` does not implicitly propagate from outer scopes to inner ones).
* `@nodiscard` has no semantic effect on declarations other than aggregate and
  function declarations.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

No breaking changes or deprecations are anticipated.

## Reviews
### Community Review Round 1

[Reviewed Version](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/58b29a85fdf3cbf3521235e40f2a66e141e856c2/DIPs/DIP1038.md)

[Discussion](https://forum.dlang.org/post/zlanrlqqjjtvfwbymppn@forum.dlang.org)

[Feedback](https://forum.dlang.org/post/qptthjobogooocleizvo@forum.dlang.org)

The following points were raised in the feedback thread:

* How will the cast semantics interact with `@safe`? The DIP author responded that `cast(void)` is always `@safe`.
* `@nodiscard` should not apply to `void` functions. The DIP author agreed, but noted that it's not transitive and can never be inferred, so the solution is simply for programmers not to appy it to `void` functions. The equivalent features in C++ and Rust do not make this exception.
* Regarding the "Error handling without exceptions" subsection of the Rationale:
  - It's possible to build a D interface that throws exceptions when binding to other languages
  - The commenter is aware of at least one package marked "optimized for fast execution" that throws
  - The numbers are inaccurate. The DIP author is aware of this, but the effort required for complete accuracy is prohibitive, and he believes the proposal is stronger even with inaccurate numbers than without.
* The DIP doesn't mention constructors. The DIP author replied that the rules cover this implicitly since constructors are functions.
* The DIP should mention if `@nodicard` applies when the attribute is attached to a type and a constructor is called for that type. The DIP author replied that a call to a type's construcor is a expression of that type and, therefore, when `@nodiscard` is applied to the type, the expression is non-discardable.
* The DIP does not cover template functions with auto-infered types, the return type of which can be `void` or not depending upon the template arguments. The DIP author replied he could no imagine a need to mark such a function as `@nodiscard`.
