## Abstract

This DIP proposes the addition of `static foreach`. `static foreach` is to `foreach` as `static if` is to `if`.

## Rationale

Iterating over a sequence of compile-time entities and generating declarations or statements is a reasonably common need in idiomatic D programs.
Currently, there is no particularly readable way to accomplish this. (There are solutions using string mixins or recursive template mixins.)
This DIP introduces the `static foreach` declaration/statement to fill this gap. This is a purely additive change and even though it is merely syntactic sugar (everything `static foreach` does can be achieved with a well-crafted string mixin), `static foreach` should enable a number of new idioms.


## Description

### Proposal 1: Allow `enum` and `alias` variables for unrolled `foreach` statements

**Currently**: The loop variable for an unrolled `foreach` statement is a different kind of declaration based on the current element:
```D
immutable int x=1;
int y(){}
enum z=3;
```

```D
foreach(v;AliasSeq!(x,y,z)) { ... }
```

This will lower to:

```D
{ auto v=x; { ... } }
{ alias v=y; { ... } }
{ enum v=z;  { ... } }
```

This is often fine behaviour, but sometimes one may want to force the loop variable to be consistently `alias` or `enum`.

**New**: `enum` is allowed as a storage class for a unrolled `foreach` loop variable:

```D
foreach(enum v; AliasSeq!(x,y,z)) { ... }
```
will lower to:

```D
{ enum v=x; { ... } }
{ enum v=y; { ... } }
{ enum v=z; { ... } }
```

**New**: unrolled `foreach` statements can declare a loop `alias`:

```D
foreach(alias v; AliasSeq!(x,y,z)) { }
```
will lower to

```D
{ alias v=x; }
{ alias v=y; }
{ alias v=z; }
```

(Both of these will also be allowed for the newly proposed `static foreach`.)


### Proposal 2: Add `static foreach` declaration and `static foreach` statement

**Currently**: There is no `static foreach`, but it can be emulated using string mixins:

```D
mixin({
    string s="";
    foreach (i;0..10)
    {
        s~=generateBody(i);
    }
    return s;
}());
```


The unrolled `foreach` statement exists:

```D
foreach(i; AliasSeq!(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)) { ... }
```

This is always a statement and it cannot generate externally visible declarations.


**New**: We add `static foreach` (and `static foreach_reverse`) that is to `foreach` (`foreach_reverse`) as `static if` is to `if`.

In more detail:

If the aggregate `a` is a sequence or an array, the body is copied `a.length` times. Within the `i`-th copy, the name of the `static foreach` variable is bound to the `i`-th entry of the sequence or array, either as an `enum` variable declaration (for constants) or an `alias` declaration (for symbols). (In particular, `static foreach` variables are never runtime variables.)

```D
static foreach(i; [0,1,2,3])
{
    pragma(msg, i);
}
```

Multiple `static foreach` variables are supported too.

```D
static foreach(i, v; ['a','b','c','d'])
{
    static assert(i + 'a' == v);
}
```


`static foreach` supports all of the same types of aggregates that regular `foreach` does. For aggregate types other than sequences and arrays, `static forach` first computes an array of all the aggregate elements using CTFE, and then iterates over this array. For aggregates that allow multiple `foreach` loop variables, an array of tuples is generated and the tuples are suitably unpacked during iteration.


A `static foreach` body does not introduce a new scope, therefore it can be used to generate declarations:

```D
static foreach(i; iota(0,3).map!text)
{
    mixin(`enum x`~i~`=i;`);
}

pragma(msg, x0," ",x1," ",x2); // 0 1 2
```

`static foreach` does not interact with `break` and `continue` (it is not a loop, but a code generation construct; it generates multiple versions of the body):

```D
int test(int x)
{
    int r = -1;
    switch(x)
    {
        static foreach(i; 0 .. 100)
        {
            case i:
                r = i;
                break;
        }
        default: break;
    }
    return r;
}
static foreach(i; 0 .. 200)
{
    static assert(test(i) == (i < 100 ? i : -1));
}
```

As some consider this to be potentially confusing, it has been suggested that `break` and `continue` directly inside `static foreach` should instead be compiler errors and require explicit labels. This DIP leaves this decision to the language authors, but recommends the above semantics.

### Grammar changes

First, the existing grammar is slightly refactored for reuse by `static foreach`:

```
AggregateForeach:
    Foreach ( ForeachTypeList ; ForeachAggregate )

ForeachStatement:
    AggregateForeach ScopeStatement

RangeForeach:
    Foreach ( ForeachType ; LwrExpression .. UprExpression )

ForeachRangeStatement:
    RangeForeach ScopeStatement

```

Next, the following grammar rules are added:

```
ForeachType:
    ForeachTypeAttributes[opt] BasicType Declarator
    ForeachTypeAttributes[opt] Identifier
+   ForeachTypeAttributes[opt] alias Identifier

ForeachTypeAttribute:
    ref
    TypeCtor
+   enum
```

```
StaticForeach:
    static AggregateForeach
    static RangeForeach

StaticForeachStatement:
    StaticForeach ScopeStatement

NonEmptyStatementNoCaseNoDefault:
    ...
    ConditionalStatement
+   StaticForeachStatement
    StaticAssert
    ...

StaticForeachDeclaration:
    StaticForeach DeclarationBlock
    StaticForeach : DeclDefs[opt]
    
Declaration:
    ...
    ConditionalDeclaration
+   StaticForeachDeclaration
```

(`ConditionalDeclaration` is currently not a `Declaration`, but the grammar should allow `static if` to be parsed.)

### Examples

#### Visitor pattern (Mathias Lang)

```D
import std.traits, std.meta;

abstract class Base
{
    abstract void accept(Visitor v) { v.visit(this); }
}
mixin template Accept()
{
    override void accept(Visitor v) { v.visit(this); }
}
class A: Base { mixin Accept; }
class B: Base { mixin Accept; }
class C: B { mixin Accept; }
class D: B { mixin Accept; }
class E: D { mixin Accept; }

alias Ts = AliasSeq!(Base, A, B, C, D, E);
alias BaseClass(T) = BaseClassesTuple!T[0];

abstract class Visitor
{
    static foreach(T; Ts)
    {
        void visit(T t)
        {
            static if(is(T==Base))
                assert(0);
            else
                visit(cast(BaseClass!T)t);
        }
    }
}
```


#### Wrapping an overload set ([Andrei Alexandrescu](https://forum.dlang.org/post/cgygrirvgkgxpupzzftn@beta.forum.dlang.org))

```D
import std.stdio, std.traits, std.meta;

alias Overloads(alias a) = AliasSeq!(__traits(getOverloads, __traits(parent, a), __traits(identifier, a)));

template trace(alias fun)
{
    private auto ref impl(Args...)(auto ref Args args)
    {
        write("Tracing: ", __traits(identifier, fun), "(");
        foreach (i, arg; args)
        {
            if (i) write(", ");
            write(arg);
        }
        writeln(")");
        return fun(args);
    }

    static foreach (funk; Overloads!fun)
    {
        auto ref trace(Parameters!funk args)
        {
            return impl(args);
        }
    }
}

double foo(ref int x, string y)
{
    ++x;
    return x + y.length;
}

double foo(string a, ref int x, string y)
{
    ++x;
    return x + y.length + a.length;
}

void main()
{
    int a = 1;
    assert(trace!foo(a, "hello") == 7);
    assert(a == 2);
    assert(trace!foo("meh", a, "hello") == 11);
    assert(a == 3);
}
```

#### Generating unit tests ([Dylan Knutson](http://forum.dlang.org/post/nqwbtvbellqaevkeiwkr@forum.dlang.org))

```D
import std.meta;

T foo(T)(ref T thing)
{
    thing++; return thing * 2;
}

static foreach(Type; AliasSeq!(int, long, uint))
{
    unittest
    {
        Type tmp = 5;
        import std.stdio;
        assert(foo(tmp) == 12);
    }
    
    unittest
    {
        Type tmp = 0;
        foo(tmp);
        assert(tmp == 1);
    }
}
```

#### Generating fields ([Vladimir Panteleev](https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/6760#issuecomment-300590321))

```D
static struct GetOptArgs
{
    static foreach (n, field; config.getoptConfig)
        mixin("std.getopt.config config%d = std.getopt.config.%s;".format(n, field));
    static foreach (n, param; Params)
        mixin("string selector%d; OptionValueType!(Params[%d])* value%d;\n".format(n, n, n));
}
```

```D
static struct Result
{
    static foreach (unit; units)
        mixin("long " ~ unit ~ ";");
}
```

## Limitations of this DIP / possible future improvements

This DIP focuses on aspects of `static foreach` that are as uncontroversial as possible in order to have a high chance of acceptance. There are however future directions that are worth exploring and useful to keep in mind when evaluating the current DIP.

### Mixin identifiers

One use case of `static foreach` is generating multiple declarations with different names. Currently, the only way to accomplish this is to turn the entire declaration whose name should vary into a string mixin. In this case, `static foreach` is not as much of an improvement as it could be. To mitigate this, we could allow [mixin identifiers](https://forum.dlang.org/post/ml51m4$tl9$1@digitalmars.com), as proposed by Idan Arye. (They would be useful beyond `static foreach` applications.)

```D
static foreach(ident;["foo","bar"])
{
    auto mixin(ident)()
    {
        // code for foo/bar
    }
}
```

This DIP does not propose adding mixin identifiers.

### Local declarations

Currently, the only declarations that are local to the `static foreach` body instead of inserted into the enclosing scope are the loop variables themselves. It could be useful to allow declarations that are local to the `static foreach` body.

```D
static foreach(i; 0 .. 10)
{
    __local import std.conv: text;
    __local enum name = text("foo",i); // note: no multiple declaration error
    mixin(text("int ",name,"(int x){ return i+x; }"));
    static foreach(j;-10..10)
        static assert(mixin(name)(j) == i+j);
}
```

This feature is already implemented except for imports, but would be disabled prior to merging. There could be a better syntax for declaring local symbols.

### State

This DIP does not propose a mechanism to keep state between loop iterations. This is easy to add, however. One way to support state is to provide an implicit `alias` that refers to the local symbols of the previous iteration.

```D
template staticMap(alias F, T...)
{
    static foreach(i; 0 .. T.length)
    {
        static if (i == 0) __local alias previous = AliasSeq!();
        else __local alias previous = __previous.current;
        __local alias current = AliasSeq!(previous, F!(T[i]));
        static if (i+1 == T.length) alias staticMap = current;
    }
}
```

This feature is already implemented, but would be disabled prior to merging. There might be a better way to provide state.

### `static break` and `static continue`

We could provide imperative control flow constructs for controlling `static foreach` expansion, but this DIP does not propose adding them.

```D
static foreach(i;iota(int.max))
{
    static if (i^^3 > 123) static break;
    if (i%2 != 0) static continue;
    static assert(i^^3 <= 123 && (i%2)==0);
}
```

### Allowing `alias` and `enum` on regular `foreach` loop variables

Currently, it is an error to use `alias` or `enum` on a regular `foreach` loop:

```D
foreach(enum i; 0 .. 3){ ... } // error
```

It has been suggested that this should instead unroll the loop, such that it becomes equivalent to:

```D
foreach(enum i; AliasSeq!(0,1,2)) { ... }
```
