## Description

The change would introduce a way to declare the need for tail call optimization (TCO)
 on functions forcing a Compilation Error if the compiler is not able to apply
 the optimization.
This allows to rely on this common optimization without uncertainty on the
 performance and call stack usage.


Currently using a new `@tco` attribute is considered, as it would follow `@nogc`,
 but using `pragma(tco, true)` as with the inline can also be used and it would
 change the need for a new attribute to a new pragma identifier. Having any
 implementation would solve the TCO uncertainty problem.


### Rationale

It can be argued that tail recursive functions are usually clearer than their
 explicit loop in-place formulation, but the latter has been historically
 preferred to gain predictable execution and no chance for a stack overflow.

The focus of this DIP is to remove the need to enforce this pattern by allowing
 recursive functions to explicitly state their need for Tail Call Optimization,
 up to the point that a Compilation Error is preferred if it's not possible to 
 apply.


The choice between using an attribute or a new pragma identifier is not yet
 decided. Currently Pros and cons are,

| `@tco`                                | `pragma(tco, true)`                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| + like `@nogc`                        | + like `pragma(inline, true)`         |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| - requires new attribute              | - requires new pragma identifier      |
|                                       | - The spec allows to ignore it        |



### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Unless the user had a `@tco` attribute set there should be no breakage at all.
Maybe the attribute name should be changed to `@forceTailCallOptimization` to
 ensure that the chances of collision with User Defined Attributes are minimal,
 but `@tco` would follow short names like `@nogc`.

There is no deprecation involved.


### Examples

``` d
@tco  // Should fail compilation (at least ldc -O3 can't optimize this)
int factorial(int n) {
    return n*factorial(n-1);
}

@tco  // Compiles <=> the compiler applied the Tail Call Optimization
int accFactorial(int n, int acc=1) {
    return accFactorial(n-1, n*acc);
}
```
