## Abstract

In a programming language, keywords are not usable as identifier. We propose
a way to override the problem, which is to use an escape symbol to denote
that the textual representation of a keyword is an identifier.

## Description

In D, a keyword cannot be an identifier. 
The style guide suggests to use an underscore when an identifier matches to a keyword.

```D
struct Function {}
Function function_;
```
D has an option for casual pre-processing of tokens. This feature is barely used.
It's based on the `#` token. We could use it to turn a keyword into an identifier,
using an escape system, like in the _C#_ or _Object Pascal_ languages.

A `#` folowed by a keyword would simply mean that what looks to a keyword is
actually an identifier.

The processing would happen during the scanning. Technically we would add
a rule for `SpecialTokenSequence`:

```
SpecialTokenSequence:
    # line IntegerLiteral EndOfLine
    # line IntegerLiteral Filespec EndOfLine
    # Keyword

Filespec:
    " Characters "
```

`# Keyword` would turn any `Keyword` into an identifier during the lexing phase.
This would have effect for example that

```D
void main()
{
    string #delegate;
    #delegate = __traits(identifier, #delegate);
    assert(#delegate == "delegate");
}
```

is valid. An implementation is already provided.

### Rationale

- It casually happens the case where we need to deserialize an object that contains 
as member a variable whose name is a keyword in D but not in the source. For such
cases, we could use the escape method so that the identifiers match.
- **body** could be used as an identifier (see DIP 1003).
- object inspectors (UI) can display properties whose names are also keywords.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

None.
