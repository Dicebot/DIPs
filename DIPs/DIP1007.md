## Abstract

In a programming language, keywords are not usable as identifier. 
We propose a way to override the problem, which is to use an escape symbol to denote that a keyword is an identifier.

## Description

In D, a keyword cannot be an identifier. 
The style guide suggests to append an underscore at the end of the identifier that matches to a keyword.

```D
struct Function {}
Function function_;
```

D has an option for casual pre-processing of tokens. This feature is barely used.
It's based on the `#` token. We could use it to turn a keyword into an identifier, using an escape system, like in the _C#_ or _Object Pascal_ languages.

A `#` folowed by a keyword would simply mean that what looks to a keyword is actually an identifier.

The processing would happen during the scanning. 
Technically we would add a rule for [`SpecialTokenSequence`](https://dlang.org/spec/lex.html#special-token-sequence):

```
SpecialTokenSequence:
    # line IntegerLiteral EndOfLine
    # line IntegerLiteral Filespec EndOfLine
    # Keyword

Filespec:
    " Characters "
```

`# Keyword` would turn any `Keyword` into an identifier during the lexing phase.
In the implementation we do a singe forward lookup to detect a keyword after `#`.
When the detection is positive we simply patch the token type (the `Token.value` member) and we remove the `#` from the token list.
The next compiler phase, the grammar parsing, is not affected since the constructs are detected using the tokens type.

### Rationale

- It casually happens the case where we need to deserialize an object that contains  as member a variable whose name is a keyword in D but not in the source. 
For such cases, we could use the escape method so that the identifiers match.
- **body** could be used as an identifier (see DIP 1003).
- object inspectors (in user interfaces) can display properties whose names are also keywords.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

None.

### Examples

Use `__traits(identifier)` to verify that the variable name for `#delegate` is well the same as the keyword `delegate`.

```D
void main()
{
    string #delegate;
    #delegate = __traits(identifier, #delegate);
    assert(#delegate == "delegate");
}
```

Deserialize a game character with a typical "class" property.

```D
string str = q{{"class" : "Hobbit", "name" : "Rufus Mugwort"}};

string #class;
string name;

JSONValue js = parseJSON(str);
if (const(JSONValue)* v = "class" in js)
   #class = v.toString;
if (const(JSONValue)* v = "name" in js)
   name = v.toStr

```

With an automatic serialization system, based on introspection, we would be able to write a valid new character without any trick to get "class" written.
