## Abstract

The results of `__traits()` is limited by the protection attributes. During a full decade, 
this limitation was actually not applied because of the bug 314. The resolution of this
bug has a negative impact since it diminishes the power of the traits.

This DIP proposes to give a full visibility to the traits that are concerned and to add
a new trait, similar to `allMembers` that will respect the visibility.

## Description

### New trait

The trait `allVisibleMembers` will behave exactly as `allMembers` except that the protection attributes will be applied.
Since the results of `allMembers` are often used as source in the other traits, `allVisibleMembers` will prevent to pass 
inaccessible member to them.

It's also worth mentioning that `getProtection` can be used to stay compliant with the protection attributes.

### Changes applied to the existing traits

- `allMembers`: see all.
- `getMember`: see all.
- `getOverloads`: see all.
- `derivedMembers`: see all.
- (TODO: complete the list)

It doesn't matter if they see everything, as memtioned previously `allVisibleMembers` acts as a filter.

### Rationale

#### History of protection attributes

Protection attributes such as `private` and `public` appeared especially because of the Object Oriented
programming paradigm (added to Simula in 1987). Applied to the traits, they limit the creativity since
D is multi paradigm. Meta programming is particularly affected by the limitation.

#### Library traits

The problem was detected for the firsdt time shortly after the phobos addition `getMemberUDA()`.
The languages traits could be used to implement easily more library traits. However the protection
attribute would make them unusable in many scenario.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

No breaking changes. User that prefer safety could use `allVisibleMembers`.

### Examples

```D
module thing;

struct A
{
   private int _field;
   int value;
}
```

```D
module stuff;

import std.stdio, thing;

void unleashed()
{
   foreach(member; __traits(allMembers, thing.A))
      write(member, " "); // _field value
}

void protectionCompliant()
{
   foreach(member; __traits(allVisibleMembers, thing.A))
      write(member, " "); // value
}

```
