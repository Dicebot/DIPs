## Rationale

If a new syntax could be devised to remove the "extra plumbing" that `in` and `out` contracts currently require, their use would probably increase. Aptly characterizing the problem, [Jonathan M. Davis says,](http://forum.dlang.org/post/mailman.2288.1494811099.31550.digitalmars-d@puremagic.com) "The amount of extra code required around in/out contracts is part of why I almost never use them. In most cases, it just makes more sense to put the assertions in the function body and not have all of that extra plumbing right after the function signature."

This sentiment is probably very common. Even a code base that uses contracts, like [SDC](https://github.com/SDC-Developers/SDC/), must adhere to a strict formatting style to keep them manageable. [For example:](https://github.com/SDC-Developers/SDC/blob/master/src/d/parser/expression.d#L1059)
```d
ulong strToDecInt(string s) in {
    assert(s.length > 0, "s must not be empty");
} body {
    ulong ret = 0;
    ...
}  
```
The same contract in any other formatting style, including the standard style of DMD and Phobos, would cause them to take up so much space that they would not be worthwhile:
```d
ulong strToDecInt(string s)
in
{
    assert(s.length > 0, "s must not be empty");
}
body
{
    ulong ret = 0;
}
```

Yet `in` and `out` contracts still have their uses. And history shows that a small change in syntax can dramatically affect programmers' willingness to use a given construct.

(Author's note: The recent acceptance of [DIP1003](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/DIP1003.md) has changed the keyword `body` to `do`, but for simplicity's sake, `body` is used in this proposal's example code.)

## Description
### Preliminary

The main proposal requires the introduction of the following three syntactic enhancements:

#### 1. Allow `in` and `out` statements with semicolons

Expand the grammar of `in` and `out` statements to include regular statements in addition to bracketed block statements. Example:
```d
in assert(x);
out(r) assert(r);
```
would be lowered to this:
```d
in { assert(x); }
out(r) { assert(r); }
```
This enhancement preserves the basic idea of contracts as statements. Added to D, it would arguably be an improvement by itself, as many programmers are deterred from writing one-line contracts simply because of the brackets and formatting they require.

#### 2. Allow multiple `in` and `out` statements

The compiler groups all `in` statements, which must be consecutive, into a single contract, with multiple statements maintaining lexical order in the lowered code. It does the same thing with `out` statements, with one restriction: there may be only one `out` statement that defines a return identifier. That identifier may still be used in the other `out` statements, if desired.

By themselves, multiple such `in` and `out` statements seem unnecessary. But when unbracketed, readability can improve. This:
```d
in assert(x);
in assert(y);
out(r) assert(r);
out assert(z);

```
would lower to this:
```d
in {
    assert(x);
    assert(y);
}
out(r) {
    assert(r);
    assert(z);
}
```
#### 3. Allow contracts within the function body

They must occur at the beginning of the function, and act as syntax sugar for external contracts. This:
```d
int fun(int x)
{
    in { assert(x); }
    out(r) { assert(r); }
    ...
}
```
gets lowered to:
```d
int fun(int x)
in { assert(x); }
out(r) { assert(r); }
body {
    ...
}
```

Virtual interface functions cannot use this syntax, as the existence of contracts in a function body implies the existence of that body.  To generate documentation, rewrite the contracts using the old style, if necessary.

Note that it's possible to allow enhancements 1 and 2 only within function bodies.

### Proposal

Combining enhancements 1, 2, and 3 above, this example of current D:
```d
int noZeroAdd(int a, int b)
in {
    assert(a);
    assert(b);
}
out(r) {
    assert(r);
}
body {
    return a + b;
}
```
can now be written like this:
```d
int noZeroAdd(int a, int b) {
    in assert(a);
    in assert(b);
    out(r) assert(r);

    return a + b;
}
```
The more familiar use with brackets is still allowed, even in the body:
```d
int noZeroAdd(int a, int b) {
    in {
        assert(a);
        assert(b);
    }
    out(r) {
        assert(r);
    }

    return a + b;
}
```
## Alternatives

Any of the three enhancements above can be combined separately to produce alternatives. In particular, if enhancement 3 is deemed too extravagant, enhancement 1, or the combination of enhancements 1 and 2, may still be desirable.

Additionally, the syntax of the existing proposal is restricted. It could be expanded in a couple ways:

#### 4. Allow contracts with conditional compilation. For example,
```d
int fun(int a) {
    version(none) in assert(a);
    static if (true) in assert(a);
}
```
#### 5. Allow contract statements anywhere in the function body
```d
int fun(int a) {
   int b;
   in assert(a);
   b = a;
   out(r) assert(r);
   return b;
}
```
It also need not be required that they be grouped together.

Also, a variety of alternatives has been suggested in the forums. The details can be found in the following links:

- [allow contracts as naked expressions](http://forum.dlang.org/post/qxlihdtknfobguubugym@forum.dlang.org)
- [imply `assert` in contracts](http://forum.dlang.org/post/mailman.2337.1494961562.31550.digitalmars-d@puremagic.com)
- [@uda based contracts](http://forum.dlang.org/post/ckznaermqjadwamqaewd@forum.dlang.org)
- [inspiration from the Dafny programming language](http://forum.dlang.org/post/ckznaermqjadwamqaewd@forum.dlang.org)

## Analysis

In addition to the current need to use the keyword `body` (or `do`; see [DIP1003](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/DIP1003.md)) before the function body , brackets are the main thing that make D's current contracts unwieldy to use in practice. Any variation of a new construction that allows contracts to be written without brackets will likely be an improvement. Enhancements 1 and 2 have this advantage. Critiques of each enhancement follow.

#### Critique 1

Within a function body, semicolon statements are normal and expected. But in contracts outside of a function body they would be surprising. This is an argument in favor of allowing them only within function bodies. 

#### Critique 2

The pros and cons of allowing multiple `in` and `out` statements are stated in the original description. The reason for allowing only one `out` statement to declare a return identifier is to avoid any potential confusion during the lowering.

#### Critique 3

Allowing contracts inside function bodies is likely the most controversial of the listed proposals.

Downsides:
* One downside is that seeing them has produced a cognitive dissonance in at least one programmer, [who states his objection thusly:](http://forum.dlang.org/post/ofe315$11bc$1@digitalmars.com) "Contracts are not part of the function body, they are part of the function signature. That's the point."
* The second downside is that documentation generators which are accustomed to skipping through the body of a function while parsing will have to be modified to look past the opening brace for `in` and `out` contracts first.

Benefits:
* By contrast, writing contracts at the top of the function body seems like a natural place to put them and, for many programmers, would be part of their natural workflow.
* Converting existing `assert`s to contracts and back will be easier if all they require is a prefix.
* Those programmers who dislike the requirement of having to write the word `body` (or `do`) for all functions with contracts will no longer have to do so.
* Finally, the awkwardness of semicolon statements appearing outside function bodies, as decribed in critique 1, would not be an issue if such statements were only allowed within function bodies.

#### Critique 4

Allowing conditional compilation before `in` or `out` statements seems to make sense. Such conditions could be lowered to occur after their respective keywords. For example,
```d
int fun(int a) {
    version(none) in assert(a);
    static if (true) out(r) assert(r);
    
    // could be lowered to:
    in version(none) assert(a);
    out(r) static if (true) assert(r);
}
```
That said, certain documentation parsing that requires knowledge of contracts may become more complicated, as the parser won't be able to check just for the tokens `in` or `out` for contracts before skipping the rest of the function body. 

#### Critique 5

Allowing `in` and `out` statements anywhere in the function body seems reasonable from a compiler semantic point of view, as the compiler only needs to accumulate all such statements as it encounters them. But it may not be something that the language authors want to encourage. Also, if documentation parsing requires knowledge of contracts, it will slow parsing down, as the whole function now needs to be scanned for contracts and therefore cannot be skipped over.

#### Critique of Linked Alternatives

When analyzing the alternatives, it will help to bear in mind that the main proposal has the following advantages:

- contracts are simple to write, with minimal "extra plumbing", i.e. without brackets and parentheses
- they utilize D's existing contract infrastructure
- there is minimal divergence from the existing syntax and semantics for contracts

Because of this, it is currently beyond the scope of this DIP to analyze the linked alternatives.

### Grammar

With semicolon statements allowed only inside the function body, the grammar would change as follows:

- the existing `InStatement` would be renamed to `InBlockStatement`
- existing `OutStatement` would be renamed to `OutBlockStatement`
- `InStatement` and `OutStatement` would be defined in Statement section of the grammar, under:
```
NonEmptyStatementNoCaseNoDefault:
    ...
    InStatement
    OutStatement

InStatement:
    in Statement
OutStatement:
    out Statement
    out ( Identifier ) Statement
```
### Code Breakage

No code is expected to break.
