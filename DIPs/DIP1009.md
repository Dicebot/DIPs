## Abstract

D has already made a significant commitment to the theory of [Design by Contract](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignByContract), by means of its existing `in`, `out`, and `invariant` constructs. But limitations remain to their usability. This DIP addresses the syntax aspect of those limitations by proposing a new syntax, making `in`, `out`, and `invariant` contracts much easier to read and write.

[DIP1003 discussion thread](http://forum.dlang.org/post/cklhgfbnpajbeefmwjrf@forum.dlang.org), which was the impetus for this DIP.

## Rationale

D's existing `in` and `out` contract syntaxes are hard to use for several reasons. To begin with, one must create a block statement for any contract. Because the largest share of contracts will be one line long, in order to keep this manageable for codebases that use them, a strict formatting style must be used. For example, the [SDC](https://github.com/SDC-Developers/SDC/) codebase, writes contracts [like this:](https://github.com/SDC-Developers/SDC/blob/master/src/d/parser/expression.d#L1059)
```d
ulong strToDecInt(string s) in {
    assert(s.length > 0, "s must not be empty");
} body {
    ulong ret = 0;
    ...
}  
```
The same contract in any other formatting style, including the standard style of DMD and Phobos, would cause them to take up so much space that they would not be worthwhile:
```d
ulong strToDecInt(string s)
in
{
    assert(s.length > 0, "s must not be empty");
}
body
{
    ulong ret = 0;
}
```
A second reason contracts are hard to use is that they require the use of the keyword `do` (or `body`, see [DIP1003](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/DIP1003.md)) before the function body. Any way of writing them that could eliminate this need would be an improvement.

Finally, `in` and `out` contracts in D require explicitly writing `assert` statements, or some equivalent functionality, in their code block in order to perform checks. But because of the nature of contracts, `assert` can be assumed in the vast majority of cases, and it is tedious to have to write it specifically. For the common case, the mere presence of `in` or `out` is sufficient. For those programmers who require the use of other forms of checking, the existing syntax will remain as is. 

History shows that a small change in syntax can dramatically change the usability of a language feature. By adding a new syntax for contracts, an increase in their usage can be expected.

Furthermore, because the existing `invariant` grammar is so similar to `in` and `out` contract grammar, any improvements to `in` and `out` contracts can be transferred easily to invariants as well. Consistency across language constructs is desirable.

## Description

Allow `in`, `out`, and `invariant` contracts to be written as parenthesized expressions. Allow multiple expressions of this kind. Create a new grammatical construct called ContractParameters, which copies and replaces the parameters to `assert` expressions. Use the new construct for `in`, `out`, `assert`, and `invariant` expressions alike. `in` and `out` expressions must come at the end of the function declarator suffix, and before the regular contracts, if any. `invariant` expressions require a semicolon terminator. (Body-less interface functions which use only the new syntax also require a semicolon terminator.) The keyword `do` or `body` is not required after the new `in` and `out` expressions.  The choice of syntax for `out` expressions requires a separate analysis (see the Analysis section below). For the sake of the following example, the `out` expression syntax requires a semicolon separating an optional return identifier from its subsequent ContractParameters:

```d
int fun(ref int a, int b)
   in(a > 0)
   in(b >= 0, "b cannot be negative!")
   out(r; r > 0, "return must be positive")
   out(; a !=0)
{
   // function body
}

class C {
   int data;
   invariant(data != 0, "data cannot be 0");
}

interface I {
   int fun(int a) in(a > 0); 
}
```
In existing D, the above contracts would have to be written as (and would in most cases lower to):
```d
int fun(ref int a, int b)
in {
   assert(a > 0);
   assert(b >= 0, "b cannot be negative!");
}
out(r) {
   assert(r > 0, "return must be positive");
   assert(a != 0);
}
do {
   // function body
}

class C {
   int data;
   invariant {
      assert(data != 0, "data cannot be 0");
   }
}

interface I {
   int fun(int a)
   in {
      assert(a > 0);
   } 
}
```

Note that while the new `in`, `out`, and `invariant` expressions use the same grammar as `assert`, this DIP does not declare that the built-in `assert` must be used to implement them. The built-in `assert` is a useful default, but this DIP does not prevent other runtime hooks from being implemented, if necessary.

## Analysis

The benefits of the new syntax are rather obvious. By removing the syntactic noise from the grammar, an increase in the usage of contracts can be expected.

The drawback of this conciseness is that a usability gap may open up between those who find the built-in `assert` functionality adequate to their needs, and those who, for whatever reason, are forced to use some other system of checking. The existing `in` and `out` contract syntax is still available for use by the latter. But the language now more strongly promotes using existing `assert` functionality where possible. The incentive is increased, therefore, to make `assert` serve as many people as possible.

### Analysis of the new `out` syntax

The most desirable syntax for the new `out` expression, i.e. a single parenthesized set of `assert` arguments,  is ambiguous with the existing `out` contract grammar. The presence of nothing but a single identifier inside the parentheses could be interpreted as either syntax. None of the proposed solutions is perfect.

1. The most straightforward solution is for the new grammar to require the condition to contain additional tokens when checking a non-return identifier. So instead of `out(i)`, for example, one must write `out(i != 0)`, and ambiguity is avoided. Any programmer who forgets to write those extra tokens will be met with a parsing error eventually, if not immediately.
```d
int fun(ref int i)
  out(i != 0) // okay
  out(i) // whoops! ambiguous with existing contract syntax
{
   // out contract, not function body
}
... // parsing error inevitable
```
The compiler can possibly use extra state logic to detect this particular error and assist the programmer with a helpful error message, "`out` contract expressions require more than just a single identifier", when the parsing finally fails.

But it is probably preferable to avoid this ambiguity altogether. Any proposed solution to the ambiguous `out` syntax must accomodate declaring the return identifier regardless. And all such methods of declaring return identifiers have the added advantage of parsing unambiguously with the existing syntax. Thus, simply by omitting the return identifier, they can be used unambiguously to check other variables as well, and are therefore recommended over option 1, for simplicity's sake. Two possibilities of this type follow.

2. One possibility is to use two sets of parentheses. This resembles the way the existing `out` contract syntax declares the return identifier, but it also resembles the syntax of template function declarations.
```d
int fun(ref int i)
  out(r)(r > 0)
  out()(i > 0) // unambiguous parsing of a non-return identifier
{
  ...
}
```
The two parentheses style is slightly more verbose than the semicolon style which follows.

3. The semicolon style has already been introduced:
```d
int fun(ref int i)
  out(r; r > 0)
  out(; i > 0) // unambiguous parsing of a non-return identifier
{
  ...
}
```
It is the recommended option for this DIP because, while competitive with option 2,
* it is more concise, requiring only `;` to separate the return identifier
* the semantics of the new `out` expression resemble the semantics of `for` and `foreach`, at least a little bit
* it is attractive for all new constructs to require the use of exactly one set of parentheses 

Note that existing `foreach` statements do not allow omitting the initial identifier — whereas the proposed `out` syntax does. If total consistency is desired, either both can be forced to declare an identifier that isn't used — or `foreach` can be changed, to allow omitting the identifier from it as well.

## Grammar
The grammar for `assert` parameters is redefined as ContractParameters, which is used in all the new constructs. Existing `in`, and `out` statements remain as they are. `invariant` statements are amended with the new variation. The `foreach` version of the new syntax is described here. New grammar follows:
```
ContractParameters:
    AssignExpression ,opt
    AssignExpression , AssignExpression ,opt

AssertExpression(redefined):
    assert ( ContractParameters )

InExpression:
    in ( ContractParameters )

OutExpression:
    out ( ; ContractParameters )
    out ( Identifier ; ContractParameters )

Invariant(redefined):
    invariant ( ) BlockStatement
    invariant BlockStatement
    invariant ( ContractParameters ) ;

FuncDeclaratorSuffix(redefined):
    Parameters MemberFunctionAttributes,opt ContractExpressions,opt
    TemplateParameters Parameters MemberFunctionAttributes,opt Constraint,opt ContractExpressions,opt

ContractExpressions:
    ContractExpression
    ContractExpression ContractExpressions

ContractExpression:
    InExpression
    OutExpression
```
## Code Breakage

None of the proposed syntax is currently compilable. Therefore no code is expected to break.
