## Abstract

Add a way to enforce tail call optimization. This removes uncertainty on the
 call stack size avoiding stack overflows.


### Links

  * [NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab C guidelines](http://lars-lab.jpl.nasa.gov/JPL_Coding_Standard_C.pdf) ban recursion because of the uncertainty of stack overflow.
  * [Scala's @tailrec](http://blog.richdougherty.com/2009/04/tail-calls-tailrec-and-trampolines.html) seeks to produce errors instead of poor code.
  * [D Spec on pragmas](http://dlang.org/spec/pragma.html#predefined-pragmas) allows ignoring current predefined ones.



## Description

The change would introduce a way to declare the need for tail call optimization (TCO)
 on functions forcing a Compilation Error if the compiler is not able to apply
 the optimization.
This allows to rely on TCO without uncertainty on the performance and call stack
 usage of the produced binaries.

The added value is not only stop checking the compiler's output to acknowledge that
 TCO was applied and to be sure no future changes will break the TCO, but also to
 help having stronger runtime guarantees on the program.


Currently using a new `@tco` attribute is considered, as it would follow `@nogc`,
 but using `pragma(tco, true)` as with the inline can also be used and it would
 change the need for a new attribute to a new pragma identifier. Having any
 implementation would solve the TCO uncertainty problem.


The choice between using an attribute or a new pragma identifier is not yet
 decided. Currently Pros and cons are,

| `@tco`                                | `pragma(tco, true)`                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| + like `@nogc`                        | + like `pragma(inline, true)`         |
|                                       |                                       |
| - requires new attribute              | - requires new pragma identifier      |
|                                       | - The spec allows to ignore pragmas   |

Moving TCO to the D spec has been suggested, but discouraged as the Named
 Return Value Optimization has been seen as a mistake (citation needed!).
 Requiring TCO does not solve the problem of wrongly expecting it to occur.


### Rationale

It can be argued that tail recursive functions are usually clearer than their
 explicit loop in-place formulation, but the latter has been historically
 preferred to gain predictable execution and no chance for a stack overflow.

The focus of this DIP is to remove the need to enforce this pattern by allowing
 recursive functions to explicitly state their need for Tail Call Optimization,
 up to the point that a Compilation Error is preferred if it's not possible to 
 apply.


### Breaking changes / deprecation process

Unless the user had a `@tco` attribute set there should be no breakage at all.
Maybe the attribute name should be longer to ensure that the chances of collision
 with User Defined Attributes are minimal. Alternative names are discussed later
 in this document.

There is no deprecation involved.


### Examples

``` d
@tco  // Should fail compilation (at least ldc -O3 can't optimize this)
int factorial(int n) {
	if(n<2)
		return 1;
	return n*factorial(n-1);
}

@tco  // Compiles <=> the compiler applied the Tail Call Optimization
int accFactorial(int n, int acc=1) {
	if(n<2)
		return acc;
	return accFactorial(n-1, n*acc);
}
```


### Discussion


#### Attribute/Identifier Name
There's been some discussion about the name for the attribute or pragma identifier,
 the following names have been considered,
  * tco (following @nogc short name)
  * tailrec  (as on Scala's @tailrec)
  * forceTailCallOptimization (to avoid short unmeaningful names)
Discussion on the name should be considered lower priority.
